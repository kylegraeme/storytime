Ramon hates possums, because they ate his parrot.
His parrot screamed for help before he was eaten.
Ramon didn't know that Rob and Rocco were the masterminds behind this act. 
One fateful night he came across the same vile possums that killed his precious parrot. 
They stared deeply into eachother's eyes and thought, "Wait!".
- Let's hunt a sad panda ..!
So the possum and Ramon went to Rob and Rocco's to seek revenge.
A gruesome and bloody fight ensued between the possums and the three George Brown instructors. 
No one prevailed, all combatants perished, and from hence forth this day was proclaimed George Blood Day!
